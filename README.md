# A Rust Ruby Interpreter

For fun, I'm going through the book [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/)
by Thorsten Ball (do yourself a favor and buy it). But I decided to use it as an opportunity to
practice my Rust skills, and rather than implementing the Monkey lang, I've decided to create a
Ruby interpreter instead. So I guess I'm just loosely following along with the book.

Note: this is nothing more than a personal exercise. Looking for an actual implementation of Ruby
with Rust? Check out [artichoke](https://github.com/artichoke/artichoke)
